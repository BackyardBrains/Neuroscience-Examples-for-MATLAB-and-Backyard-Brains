# Getting started with the Heart & Brain spiker Box in MATLAB & Simulink
The Live-script HeartBrainSpiker_start will get you started with the Heart and Brain spiker box.<br/>
By using the interactive live-script you will learn how to:
* Acquire data in MATLAB & Simulink
* Read & Write data/code with MATLAB & Simulink on Hardware
* Pre-process ECGs in MATLAB
* Visualize ECGs in MATLAB
* Analyze ECGs in MATLAB
* Label ECGS with Deep Learning in MATLAB
